# 🛡️ CrimeWatch App

CrimeWatch is a **full-stack crime reporting platform** that allows users to report crimes easily, quickly, and **100% anonymously**.

🔐 **Privacy First**: Users do not need to log in or share any personal details. All reports are confidential.

🧠 **Powered by Google Gemini AI**: To make reporting easier, CrimeWatch uses **Gemini AI** to help users **summarize incidents** and **auto-fill** report forms based on what they type or speak. This helps people report crimes even if they are unsure how to explain everything clearly.

## 💡 Why CrimeWatch?

Many people don’t report crimes because they:
- Feel scared
- Don’t want to reveal identity
- Don’t know how to explain the issue

CrimeWatch solves this by:
- Keeping users **anonymous**
- Giving a **simple and clear form**
- Using **AI to help write** the report
- Letting users **track report status** using just a report ID
